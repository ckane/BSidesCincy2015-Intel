\begin{slide}[toc=Intro,bm=Intro]{Introduction \& Terminology}
\begin{description}
\item[Threat Landscape] The elements typically \textbf{outside of your control} that impact your
                        security posture. This is where your threat actors, geopolitical policies,
                        third-party postures, and similar factors exist\vspace{0.25in}
\item[Attack Surface] The elements \textbf{within your control/influence} impacting your security
                      posture. Includes: Network design, user behavior, site geographies, security
                      tools, etc. Considered frequently to be what you're defending against the
                      \textbf{Threat Landscape}\vspace{0.25in}
\item[Cyber Intelligence] Knowledge of your threat landscape \& attack surface. This can be in the
                          form of structured/unstructured documentation, threat databases, tribal
                          knowledge, situational awareness, and other formats

\begin{slide}{Certainty}
Example of "certainty":\\
"\textit{You don't get to operate in the world you want, you have to operate in the world you get.}"
-- Abraham Lincoln \pause[1] [{\it\color{blue}citation needed}] \pause[1]\vspace{0.15in}

Environment is constantly in flux:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Attack Surface} - Lockheed Martin buying Sikorsky from UTC:
  {\tiny\\\url{http://www.wsj.com/articles/lockheed-agrees-to-buy-sikorsky-for-9-billion-1437392758}}
\item \textbf{Threat Landscape} - OPM breach:
  {\tiny\\\url{http://www.wired.com/2015/06/opm-breach-security-privacy-debacle/}}
\end{itemize}
Absolute certainty \textbf{doesn't exist}. Consider factors as contributing to increased or decreased
likelihood of outcomes. Define what risks will be in or out of scope.\vspace{0.15in}

\textit{I am highly confident that the risk of misuse of OPM information about employees is likelier 
now than it was in 2013}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Affecting Certainty}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Some information sources more reliable than others
 \item Deeper investigation into evidence typically increases confidence, however also increases
       delay to reporting
 \item Age of evidence typically lessens impact on certainty
 \item Detail of evidence can help identify situational contexts for which evidence is higher
       confidence ("\textit{IP is bad}" vs. "\textit{IP is bad when observed sending email}")
 \item Quantity of independent sources supporting/refuting a conclusion
 \item Quantity of sources with conflicting/competing assessments
\end{itemize}
