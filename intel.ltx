\begin{description}
\item[Threat Landscape] The elements typically \textbf{outside of your control} that impact your
                        security posture. This is where your threat actors, geopolitical policies,
                        third-party postures, and similar factors exist\vspace{0.25in}
\item[Attack Surface] The elements \textbf{within your control/influence} impacting your security
                      posture. Includes: Network design, user behavior, site geographies, security
                      tools, etc. Considered frequently to be what you're defending against the
                      \textbf{Threat Landscape}\vspace{0.25in}
\item[Cyber Intelligence] Knowledge of your threat landscape \& attack surface. This can be in the
                          form of structured/unstructured documentation, threat databases, tribal
                          knowledge, situational awareness, and other formats

\begin{slide}{Certainty}
Example of "certainty":\\
"\textit{You don't get to operate in the world you want, you have to operate in the world you get.}"
-- Abraham Lincoln \pause[1] [{\it\color{blue}citation needed}] \pause[1]\vspace{0.15in}

Environment is constantly in flux:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Attack Surface} - Lockheed Martin buying Sikorsky from UTC:
  {\tiny\\\url{http://www.wsj.com/articles/lockheed-agrees-to-buy-sikorsky-for-9-billion-1437392758}}
\item \textbf{Threat Landscape} - OPM breach:
  {\tiny\\\url{http://www.wired.com/2015/06/opm-breach-security-privacy-debacle/}}
\end{itemize}
Absolute certainty \textbf{doesn't exist}. Consider factors as contributing to increased or decreased
likelihood of outcomes. Define what risks will be in or out of scope.\vspace{0.15in}

\textit{I am highly confident that the risk of misuse of OPM information about employees is likelier 
now than it was in 2013}

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}[toc=Confidence]{Affecting Confidence}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Some information sources more reliable than others
 \item Deeper investigation into evidence typically increases confidence, however also increases
       delay to reporting
 \item Age of evidence typically lessens impact on certainty
 \item Detail of evidence can help identify situational contexts for which evidence is higher
       confidence ("\textit{IP is bad}" vs. "\textit{IP is bad when observed sending email}")
 \item Quantity of independent sources supporting/refuting conclusion
 \item Quantity of sources with conflicting/competing assessments
\end{itemize}

\begin{slide}[toc=Collection]{Intelligence Consumption: Collection}
 \begin{description}
  \item[Collection]
   \begin{itemize}
    \item What sources to collect from (and not)?
    \item What scope do you consider?
    \item Decision driving information? $\rightarrow$ Structured metadata
    \item Technical vs. Informational: Audience
    \item What internal capabilities do you have to action? Tool survey
   \end{itemize}
 \end{description}

Your \textbf{Collection Plan} consists of what information you choose to 
inform your program, as well as identifying language in that information that
will be most critical to inform decision making.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Do you use Snort (\url{http://www.snort.org})? If not, then intelligence
       in the form of Snort signatures may be something you want to exclude.
 \item CriticalStack Intel for Bro (\url{https://intel.criticalstack.com}): UI
       for creating custom collection plans. Bro-centric (\url{http://www.bro.org}).
\end{itemize}

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}[toc=Processing]{Intelligence Consumption: Processing}
\textbf{Processing}: Movement of data or material towards a known goal or end result,
by passing it through a series of stages or a sequence of actions.\vspace{0.1in}
Convert our raw material, the selected intel defined by collection plan, and run it
through processing to normalize the information for inclusion into our knowledge management
function.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Read the narrative
 \item Document the relationships between significant data points
 \item Note important contextual clues (used in data theft? ransom? DDoS?)
 \item Attack models such as "Cyber Kill Chain" can be helpful for context
 \item Organize into consistent structured output, for storage. Always store
       original source document(s) and include references to them in output
\end{itemize}

Spreadsheets / CSV as output can be surprisingly effective

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}[toc=Knowledge Mgmt]{Intelligence Consumption: Knowledge Management}
Your program's intelligence in its \textit{final form}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Program's intelligence is published for broader audience
 \item Queryable
 \item Normalized $\rightarrow$ consistent $\rightarrow$ predictable
 \item Once organized, it becomes easier to reorganize
 \item Old raw collections are easy to search/retrieve. Periodically re-process
       old intelligence as program matures
\end{itemize}

The organization of this system is driven by two factors:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Minimize pivots and external investigation by event analysts (regular feedback to drive this)
 \item Support dynamic signature deployment, using queries on collected context, with minimal tool-local
       modifications chasing each new collection
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}[toc=]{Intelligence Consumption: CRITs}
CRITs: \url{https://crits.github.io}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Open-Source, strong community support (developed by Mitre, contributors
       include GE, Ashland Inc., and growing)
 \item MongoDB helps support frequent collection plan changes
 \item Start with \textit{something} to build from, rather than scratch
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{crits-rels}
\end{figure}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}[toc=Analysis]{Intelligence Analysis}
Researching your collected intelligence to produce further intelligence that can
be leveraged by your program.\vspace{0.1in}

Examples:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Search for network indicators buried in lists of strings from EXEs
 \item Look across collected IP addresses associated with Corkow malware to
       identify network subnets containing 5 or more distinct IP addresses
       used for Command \& Control
 \item Gather domains associated with "APT28 campaign" (FireEye), to identify WHOIS
       information which is exclusively used for domains by that group
\end{itemize}

Preferred approach is to publish an internal analysis report, documenting conclusions
with supporting evidence, and meeting as many collection requirements as possible in
your narrative.\vspace{0.1in}

Feed the publication through your existing intelligence process:\\\textbf{Eat your own dog food}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}[toc=Reporting]{Intelligence Reporting: ELI5}
\textit{Explain Like I'm Five}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{eli5}
\end{figure}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}[toc=]{Intelligence Reporting}
Can be treated similarly to \textit{Analysis}, however also intended to inform an audience
outside of your security team. Summarize away deep technical details, but also consolidate
information from Analysis references into the same report.\vspace{0.1in}

Inside security team, treat just like analysis publications:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Simplifies program
 \item Helpful for training (your own team is in flux as much as the threat landscape)
 \item Queryable records for "Where and when have we reported this outside our team?"
\end{itemize}

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}[toc=Deployment]{Intelligence Deployment}
Deployment of intelligence describes delivering data from knowledge management into instructions
for your tools / systems to watch for it in your attack surface. Using metadata collected and
processed above, you can define static queries to retrieve intelligence stored in your program
appropriate for specific uses.\vspace{0.1in}

Example:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Process lists of IP addresses from known DDoS attacks
 \item Non-optimal to deploy them into Snort alerts
 \item Use Bro or similar to log connection-level metadata into elasticsearch
 \item Deploy to automated elasticsearch query that can report a single alert documenting
       all activity after exceeding a certain threshold
\end{itemize}

Return all IP address values into a JSON list where the IP address in CRITs contains at least one
metadata object of type "Historic Activity" who's value is "DDoS".
